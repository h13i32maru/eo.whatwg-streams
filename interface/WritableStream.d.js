 * @param {function} [underlyingSink.write] this stream is written chunk. write chunk to underlying sink in this function.
 * this function is called when producer write chunk to this stream. if returns Promise, wait for Promise is resolved.<br/>
 *
 * ``write(chunk)`` each arguments are
 * - ``chunk: Object`` chunk of data.
